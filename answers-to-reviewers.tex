\subsection{Comment 1}
\hrulefill\\

Title:
I do not see why the authors have named it “A simple path optimization method” as it is significantly more complex than the classical random sampling based methods. A title with something like “A gradiant based optimization method…” would be much more fitting in my view.

\rule{\linewidth}{.1pt}
\textbf{Answer}:

%The authors agree with the reviewers that this sentence should be modified as it is unclear.
We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. The proposed title is indeed much more precise. We changed the title accordingly.

\subsection{Comment 2}
\hrulefill\\

Introduction: 
It would be very nice with a discussion of what optimal means. Optimal can be with respect to path length (the classical criteria also used in this paper), but could just as well be optimal with respect to execution time, where the number of via points and the clearance (allowing for larger blends) are important factors. Optimal could also depend on some task specific objectives. 

\rule{\linewidth}{.1pt}
\textbf{Answer}:

We have developed the meaning of optimality, and we refer to a recent paper ACM-Com by one of the author.

Concerning the choice to optimize the path length, we... by choosing the length we get a quadratic criterion, which is easier blablabla...

\subsection{Comment 3}
\hrulefill\\

The introduction contains a reference to figure 6, which is in the results section. This long reference forces the reader to flip many pages back and forth. Please either just explain the content or put the figure earlier.

\rule{\linewidth}{.1pt}
\textbf{Answer}:

As suggested, the figure was moved to the introduction.

\subsection{Comment 4}

Related work: 
The work in [11] is also described in an IJRR paper of the same authors. This paper could be cited as well.

\rule{\linewidth}{.1pt}
\textbf{Answer}:

As suggested, the reference has been changed to cite the journal paper.

\subsection{Comment 5}
\hrulefill\\

Section 3:
The paper starts describing the details of the algorithm and reference to algorithm 2 placed several pages later. It would make the paper more readable if the overall algorithm was presented earlier making the reader aware of where the components would be used before describing them. This would also mean that the reader does not have to flip back and forth all the time.

\rule{\linewidth}{.1pt}
\textbf{Answer}:

We understand that starting to define the algorithm's functions and reference to it too early is confusing. To enhance it, we choose to decouple the algorithm from the problem definition, and define the functions in the algorithm section. This method may seem redundant but avoid the reader to flip back and forth to find the functions definitions.
Furthermore, we prefer to not introduce the algorithm earlier because .... \todo

Section 3.5.1:
This section does not read a nicely as the previous. Simplifying the notation by using sub/super scripts to define the reference frame of points rather than having the long expression for u, may help a bit.

\subsection{Comment 7}
\hrulefill\\

Results:
The authors only compares their approach with random shortcut and partial random shortcut, but omit the standard path pruning technique also described in [11]. This technique works excellent for the special case in Figure 6. 

\rule{\linewidth}{.1pt}
\textbf{Answer}:

ANSWER
It is true that in the case of Figure 6, Prune is complementary to random shortcut, but this method, used alone, has also it's counter-examples, as the one presented in Figure 1 (and the PR2-crossing-arms Figure \todo).

\subsection{Comment 8}
\hrulefill\\

In the paper the authors state that it can be hard to select the stopping criteria of the random short cutting algorithms, for which the authors have selected five iterations with non-improvement. Looking at the time it takes before the optimization algorithms terminates (Table 2) it appears that this criterion is too harsh as the PRS and RS in many cases terminates significantly before the GB based method. To show if their method is indeed more efficient they should try to let the RS and PRS run for the same amount of time as the GB method. It would also be nice if Table 2 would include the number of iterations and potentially selected plots showing how the path length decreases as a function of time/iterations.

\subsection{Comment 9}
\hrulefill\\

Related to my previous comment about path pruning, then I would generally recommend people to use a combination of the deterministic path pruning followed by random short cut algorithm, as this in my experience performs better (in terms of how much it can optimize in a given time) then using just short cutting.

1) Notation and clarity of the presentation:

When introducing the Jacobian of f, at no point has f been introduced as the constraint function. I think in general the problem should be introduced as an optimization problem, what is the objective, what are the constraints, what simplifications will be made.

In that regard it would be nice to comment the Newton method, for example there exists many methods to select alpha. Having a constant alpha the most naïve approach.

The iteration index notation and the time index use the same letter (i), making it difficult to follow. The p variable is sometimes called back with mention of what it is.

\subsection{Comment 6}

2) Too few and unfair comparisons

The experimental section leaves the impression that the comparisons with other methods are either giving the advantage to the state-of-the-art or, simply unfair. 

Tuning the shortcut method by changing the distribution of samples along the path drastically changes the converging behavior, so choosing '5 non improving iterations' as the stopping criterion is very arbitrary. And it is the case in the results that the GB method beats the other methods using 1000 times the budget allocated to the other methods... I think reducing the comparison to one number in this case does not allow the reader to get a fair estimate of the convergence rate. A common criterion to be used is simply a max iteration count, which would already be fairer, but in order to not have these criteria influence the comparison, why not plot the averaged convergence curves?

Otherwise it would be interesting to see the alpha parameter being discussed at that point in the paper (with experimental results to back up the discussion).
